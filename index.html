						<h2>Vision Statement</h2>
					</header>

					<span><b>Lingual</b></span>
					<p>For native English-speaking adults who are looking to learn a new language completely from
						scratch, Lingual is a language learning application that offers a variety of methods for a user
						to practice their pronunciation, comprehension, reading, and writing of a new language. Learning
						a language can be difficult, but Lingual was created to make learning a new language fun and
						manageable through a variety of lesson plans and interactive review exercises.<br><br>



						Lingual has a variety of languages to choose from, each with its own custom language learning
						path tailored to the native English speaker. Each language path consists of multiple lessons
						accompanied by comprehensive documentation as well as a short test to help the user practice
						what they just learned. After users complete language lessons, they can go back to review them
						at any time or move on to more advanced topics.<br><br>



						Unlike other language learning apps, Lingual allows users to choose what they want to learn
						about their target language by splitting up language learning points of focus such as
						vocabulary, symbols, and tenses into separate categories to allow for a more customized and
						organized way to learn a new language. Lingual also allows users to review the vocabulary,
						symbols, and tenses they have learned from completed lessons at any time with various review
						methods to choose from.<br><br>



						Lingual will be considered successful if users are able to complete a set of lessons for a given
						language. A set of lessons varies in size depending on the entry level and language. For each
						language and level the user would like to begin at, there will be an estimated time for how long
						it will take the user to complete the lessons for the language. If the user is able to complete
						a set of lessons it will show that they were able to successfully learn part of a new language.
						Lingual from a business side will be a successful application if out of the estimated 100
						million English speakers seeking to learn another language, Lingual can be used by 1% of that
						sample, equivalent to 1 million users.<br><br>



						In the future, Lingual can be expanded with new languages for users to choose from as well as
						further lessons for languages the app already includes can be added. By adding more languages to
						Lingual, it will give a user more choices to choose from and draw in more users to use our app.
						In addition, Lingual can also be used to save 'dying languages' by offering them as a language
						to learn. By such languages to the options offered on Lingual, there is potential to receive
						support in the form of government funding to help with the effort to revitalize the
						languages.<br><br>



						Lingual in the long term can be continually expanded to include more lessons to increase user's
						fluency of a chosen language. With the inclusion of more lessons it will continue to engage
						users who have successfully completed all lessons for a given language. With the potential
						growth of adding new languages, and lessons, Lingual can continue to provide users a helpful
						tool in learning a language.</p>

					<header>

						<h2>Intended Users</h2>
					</header>

					<p>
						Lingual's user base specifically applies to native English speaking adults. The reason for this
						specific scope, is that depending on your native language, how you learn a language and how easy
						a particular language is to learn will vary. For example, a native French speaker may have an
						easier time learning Spanish because both French and Spanish belong to the Romance language
						family. In other words, they are both derived from Vulgar Latin and as a result they have many
						similar grammatical structures and words. Another example would be that a native Japanese
						speaker might have an easier time learning Chinese since they are already experienced in
						memorizing many different characters for their own writing system. Lingual explains lessons and
						highlights common difficulties for the user's target language in a way that native English
						speakers will best understand. Secondly, the skills and resources a person uses to learn a new
						language differs between adults and children. Lingual chose to focus on adults (18+), and
						therefore also tailors its learning environment to this age group. Lessons are explained at the
						high-level, and include details, nuances, and other uncommon factors in their explanation not
						usually taught to a younger age group since on average, they have less learning capacity and
						skills compared to adults. Furthermore, it should be noted that Lingual is not intended for
						elderly adults (70+). This is due to the fact that at that age, cognitive and memory-related
						problems are more common which might interfere with Lingual's approach to learning. Within the
						capacity of native English speaking adults, Lingual can still be applied to a wide variety of
						users such as: a post-secondary student studying a second language, someone who travelled to a
						country that speaks a different language for pleasure or work-related reasons, someone wanting
						to learn a new language while in quarantine, or a person that wants to learn a relative's native
						language.

						<h2>VELOCITY CHART</h2>
					</header>
					<a class="image fit">
						<img src="images/velocity.png">
					</a>
					<span>Our velocity graph shows that for both iteration one and two we over-committed. Our group was
						very ambitious with what we wanted to accomplish but it was difficult to complete all the tasks
						in time. Our iteration two commitment increased by so much because some of the tasks that were
						not completed in iteration one then were pushed to iteration two. Although for both iterations
						we were not able to complete all the desired tasks we did improve on how much actual time we
						completed. For iteration three we were able to complete all tasks and even had additional
						features added that we originally were not planning on having done until a later iteration. We
						committed a few more days than what we originally estimated but all at the expense of having our
						final app up to our groups standards</span>

						<h2>Sales Pitch</h2>
					</header>

					<span><i>Countries and families are becoming increasingly culturally mixed, businesses are putting a
							greater focus on international communication between their branches, and the economic
							potential for international travel is greater than ever. The rest of the world has learned
							to speak English, but not everything can be covered with a single language. Learn how to
							pronounce your favourite Indonesian recipe, tell your grandmother thank you in her language
							at the next family visit, read poetry and literature in its original form, write a letter to
							land a job in a foreign country and more with Lingual's language learning app. Tailored to
							the English speaker, immerse yourself in the richest cultural experience and most valuable
							skill you can learn today.</i> </span>






					<header>

						<h2>Post Mortem</h2>
					</header>

					<span><i>Our group did a really great job at coming up with an idea for an app that would also allow
							most of our group to write flashcards or lessons for another language they know. We did a
							really good job at helping one another when we needed assistance or explaining how we wanted
							our app to be designed. We struggled a little at first in iteration one with communicating
							with one another about how we were going to commit the project with so many of us working on
							it at once. After iteration one’s retrospective, we decided to assign tasks that would not
							require us to rely on one person finishing their tasks in order for the next person to start
							their tasks. We definitely saw improvement from iteration one to two but agreed that we need
							to make sure that tasks that rely on one another are done at the beginning of the iteration.
							What we thought would be the basic features of having a language list to choose from,
							lessons, and flashcards turned out to be a lot more difficult. We originally thought we
							would be able to complete the basic functioning of our app in iteration one but now we are
							just now finishing it in iteration three. This was a surprise for us because we did not
							realize how much work went into writing good tests, setting up a database, and collaborating
							on one project.</i> </span>
